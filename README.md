# Agentic_AI

Minimal Agentic AI skeleton demonstrating a modular orchestrator, brain (planner & reasoner), tools, memory, policy, and HITL integration.

This is a lightweight demo scaffold intended for local experimentation. It is intentionally small and uses only Python stdlib for the core demo.

Quick start

1. Create a Python venv and activate it.
2. Run unit tests:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s C:\MLops\Agentic_AI\tests
```

Next steps: install optional dependencies (LLM SDKs, vector DBs), implement sandboxed executors, and integrate with your CI and git provider.
